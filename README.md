# Nanopore-Workflow
Snakemake workflow to process and filter long read data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.  It is designed to compare whole human genome tumor/normal pairs of Nanopore sequencing runs.  It is suggested to have at least 15x - 20x of coverage, and a median read length of at least 5kbp - 6kbp.
